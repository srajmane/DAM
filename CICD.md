## CI/CD Pipeline

- We can use GitHub Actions to create a CI/CD workflow and AWS CodeDeploy to deploy our code to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in an Autoscaling group.

- GitHub Actions is a feature on GitHubâ€™s popular development platform that helps you automate your software development workflows in the same place that
  you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues. You can write individual tasks called actions, and then combine them to create a custom workflow. Workflows are custom automated
  processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.
  
- AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless AWS Lambda functions,
  or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services.
  
 - We can create stagging stage and production stage to verify our code changes.
