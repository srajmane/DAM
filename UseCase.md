## Digital Asset Management

### Workflow
- **Digital Content Creation**  
  ```
  Digital asset required enconding and decoding for creations. In our organization we are creating different types of data 
  like logo, images, 2D, 3D design and videos with different format.Content creation also marks as the first step in the process flow of the DAM.
  ```
- **Metadata of Digital Asset**
  ```
  Enhance your media files with metadata. So, that you can name your file , along with its description, 
  modification dates, locations, original creation date, size of the file, encoding, packaging, access rights, etc.
  ```
- **Different versions**
  ```
  Provides multiple versions of the same asset. Users can create multiple versions of the same asset and store them by the same name as well.
  For example, if you create a video, the system will allow you to create its different versions like high quality, medium quality 
  and low quality along with different media types like MP4, 3GP, OGG, WMV, WEBM, etc.
  ```
- **File Storage**
  ```
  These files can be stored, both online as well as offline. Most of the media files require a large space in the database because of
  rich media files being generally heavier in nature. In these cases, extra storage devices like hard drives or cloud space are often required.
  Digital Asset Management tools prove to be useful here as they provide their own in-built storage space.
  ```
- **Classify your assets**
  ```
  Search which allows us to sort files, for convenience purpose. Create folder structure where a user can drag and drop the files from one folder to another.
  ```
  
- **Search**
  ```
  Organizing files and data. Indexing of the content is also a part of the data organization.
  The indexing feature consists of a search bar that helps to provide data and files to a user within a fraction of seconds.
  ```
  
- **Access Control**
  ```
  DAM system provides access control and user management. Every DAM system provides internal security to your digital assets.
  ```
  
- **Asset Performance Monitoring**
  ```
  Once you post your asset online, measuring its performance should be your next and probably the final step. DAM provides you with tracking and monitoring performances of your digital assets.
